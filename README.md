summer research 2022

Try to understand Stadel's dissertation, Owen did a bunch of 
coding.  After doing the coding he wrote his final report
for the summer 2022.  As of 2022-08-05 I am in the middle
of reading/editing that report.

Owen's on Git Hub site is Alive 7.

Noah Unger-_____ gave a talk at M. Galassi's institute, and I 
attended.  He presented lots of graphs comparing various treecodes:
binary, oct-trees, etc.  Noah also had plots comparing Runge-Kutta
versus leapfrog.  I could follow the talk very well.
